Take frequent breaks to stretch and move around, or consider using an adjustable workstation. Maintain good posture to avoid back pain and other physical discomfort. Educate Yourself: Familiarize yourself with the safety guidelines and regulations specific to pottery. Research and understand the potential hazards associated with pottery materials and processes. Stay up-to-date on industry safety practices and innovations. Key Takeaways:\nPrioritize ventilation to prevent inhalation of clay dust and fumes. Handle chemicals with caution, wear protective gear, and dispose of them properly. Ensure electrical safety by checking equipment, using proper outlets, and installing a circuit breaker. Be mindful of sharp objects, wear appropriate safety gear, and store tools safely. Maintain good posture to avoid physical strain and discomfort.
