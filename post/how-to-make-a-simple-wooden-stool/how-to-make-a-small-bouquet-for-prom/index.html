Tuck in some small leaves or ferns around the flowers, securing them with floral wire or florist&rsquo;s tape. This will create a more organic and cohesive look.</p></li><li><p><strong>Play with textures:</strong> Don&rsquo;t shy away from mixing textures in your bouquet.

This contrast will add visual interest and depth to your arrangement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Think height and movement:</strong> When arranging your bouquet, think about creating some height and movement. Use taller flowers as the focal point and shorter ones to fill in the gaps. Incorporate flowers that have a natural arch or curve to add a dynamic element to your bouquet.</p></li></ul><h3 id=key-takeaways><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-takeaways>#</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Ribbon allure:</strong> Wrap a ribbon around the base of the stems to add elegance and sophistication.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embellished charm:</strong> Add beads, sequins, or diamantes to the flowers or stems for a touch of sparkle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leafy elegance:</strong> Tuck in some small leaves or ferns around the flowers for a natural touch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Textured delight:</strong> Mix soft and fluffy flowers with harder-edged blooms to create visual interest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Height and movement:</strong> Use taller flowers as the focal point and incorporate flowers with a natural arch or curve to add dynamic elements.
