Swanky finishes and intricate designs bump up the price.\nRVs: They generally start at $10,000 for a basic model. But remember, comfort comes at a price, and luxurious RVs can easily top $150,000.\nTransportation: Tiny Homes: These usually require special permits and transportation, adding $5,000 to $15,000 to your expenses.\nRVs: Moving these is easier, usually involving a tow vehicle. Costs vary depending on distance and size, typically ranging from $500 to $3,000.\nOngoing Costs: Utilities: Both: Utilities like electricity, water, and internet can vary greatly depending on your location, usage, and conservation efforts.\nParking or Lot Rental: Tiny Homes: Renting a parking spot or lot for your tiny home can set you back anywhere from $300 to $1,000 monthly.\nRVs: Campground fees can range from $30 to $100 per night or an average of $300 to $1,000 monthly.\nMaintenance and Repairs: Both: Maintenance costs can vary based on the age, condition, and usage of your home on wheels.
