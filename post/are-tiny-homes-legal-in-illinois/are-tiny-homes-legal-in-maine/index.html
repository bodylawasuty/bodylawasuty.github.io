If you’re thinking about joining the tiny home movement in Maine, you may be wondering about the legal and practical aspects of connecting your tiny home to utilities.

Some areas may have restrictions on the size, placement, and types of tiny homes allowed. Understanding these regulations will help you make informed decisions and avoid potential legal issues.\nWater Connections: Access to clean and safe water is a top priority for any home, including tiny homes. Depending on your location, you may have several options for connecting to a water source.
