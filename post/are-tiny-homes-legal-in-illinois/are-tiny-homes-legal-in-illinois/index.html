Are Tiny Homes Legal in Illinois?\rIllinois has seen a surge in interest in tiny homes, and for good reason. They offer an affordable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional housing. But are tiny homes legal in Illinois? The answer is a resounding yes, but there are some restrictions you need to be aware of before you start planning your dream tiny home.\nState vs. Local Regulations\rIn Illinois, tiny homes are regulated by both state and local governments. State law defines a tiny home as a dwelling unit with a maximum floor area of 400 square feet, excluding lofts. Local governments may have their own zoning regulations that further restrict the size, location, and design of tiny homes.\nBuilding Codes\rTiny homes in Illinois must comply with the same building codes as traditional homes.
