So how do you choose the right furniture?</p><p><strong>1. Get a Chair with Lumbar Support</strong>:
Look for chairs with adjustable lumbar support that prevent back pain during long work hours. Armrests should be at elbow height to ease shoulder pressure.</p><p><strong>2. Adjust Your Chair to Suit You</strong>:
Make sure your feet rest flat on the floor and your knees are slightly lower than your hips. Screens should be at eye level to avoid neck strain.</p><p><strong>3. Choose a Keyboard and Mouse that Fits</strong>:
Use ergonomic keyboards and mice that fit the size of your hands. Experiment with different types to find what’s comfortable for you.</p><p><strong>4. Add a Footrest if Needed</strong>:
If your feet don’t reach the floor, use a footrest to support your legs and reduce pressure on your back.</p><p><strong>5. Set Up Your Desk at the Right Height</strong>:
Your desk should be at a height where your elbows are at a 90-degree angle when typing. Standing desks are also an excellent option for those who suffer from back pain.</p><p><strong>6. Use a Monitor Riser</strong>:
If your monitor is too low, consider using a monitor riser to raise it to eye level, reducing neck strain.</p><p><strong>7. Invest in a Good Desk Organizer</strong>:
Keep your desk clutter-free with a well-organized system. Use drawers, trays, and vertical storage to keep things off your workspace.</p><p><strong>8. Consider an Anti-Fatigue Mat</strong>:
Standing for long periods can strain your feet and legs. Adding an anti-fatigue mat under your desk provides support and reduces discomfort.</p><p><strong>9. Take Regular Breaks</strong>:
Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes to prevent stiffness and strain. Take a short walk or stretch to keep your body active.</p><p><strong>10. Prioritize Air Quality</strong>:
Ensure proper ventilation in your home office to maintain good air quality.
