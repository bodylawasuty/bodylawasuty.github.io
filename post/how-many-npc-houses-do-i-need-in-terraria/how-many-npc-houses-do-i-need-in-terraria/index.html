Not only does this unlock valuable services and benefits, but it also adds a touch of life and personality to your world. Here are some practical tips and strategies to help you design efficient and aesthetically pleasing NPC housing:\nKey Takeaways: Plan your housing layout: Before you start building, take some time to plan out the layout of your housing area. Consider the number of NPCs you want to accommodate, as well as the services and facilities you want to provide. Use a variety of materials: Don’t be afraid to mix and match different materials to create unique and interesting housing designs. Wood, stone, brick, and glass are all popular choices, but you can also experiment with other materials like ice, crystal, or even living wood. Add decorative elements: Small details can make a big difference in the overall look of your housing area. Add furniture, paintings, banners, and other decorative items to make your houses feel more lived-in and inviting. Consider the size of your houses: While you don’t want your houses to be too cramped, you also don’t want them to be too spacious. A good rule of thumb is to make each house at least 3 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall. Make use of vertical space: If you’re limited on space, consider building your houses vertically. This can be done by using platforms, stairs, or even teleporters to connect different levels of your housing area. Don’t forget about outdoor space: Your NPCs also need some outdoor space to relax and socialize. Add benches, tables, and other outdoor furniture to create a welcoming and inviting atmosphere. Address common challenges: As you build your NPC housing, you’re likely to encounter some common challenges. Here are some tips for addressing these challenges: Dealing with too many NPCs: If you have too many NPCs, you may need to build additional housing or consider evicting some NPCs. You can also use pylons to teleport NPCs between different housing areas. Managing NPC happiness: NPC happiness is important for unlocking certain services and benefits. Make sure your NPCs have access to comfortable housing, as well as amenities like food, water, and light. Defending your housing area from enemies: Enemies can sometimes attack your housing area, so it’s important to take steps to defend it. This can be done by building walls, traps, and other defensive structures.
