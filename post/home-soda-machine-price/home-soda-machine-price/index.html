If you have a large family or frequently entertain guests, a machine with a wider flavor selection may be worth the investment.</li><li><strong>Carbonation Levels:</strong> Some machines allow you to adjust the carbonation level of your soda. This can be a handy feature if you prefer your soda more or less fizzy.</li><li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Some machines are easier to use than others.
