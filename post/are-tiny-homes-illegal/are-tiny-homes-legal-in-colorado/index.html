One challenge is that tiny homes are often seen as incompatible with traditional housing. Zoning regulations may restrict the size and location of tiny homes, making it difficult for people to find a place to park or build their tiny home. Another challenge is that tiny homes are often not considered to be permanent structures.

In 2019, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that tiny homes could be considered &ldquo;manufactured homes&rdquo; under state law. This ruling allowed tiny homes to be placed in mobile home parks and other locations that are zoned for manufactured homes. In addition, some cities and counties in Colorado have adopted ordinances that specifically allow tiny homes.</p><h3 id=q5-what-is-the-future-of-tiny-homes-in-colorado>Q5: What is the future of tiny homes in Colorado?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#q5-what-is-the-future-of-tiny-homes-in-colorado>#</a></h3><p>A5: The future of tiny homes in Colorado is uncertain.
