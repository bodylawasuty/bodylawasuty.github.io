Some older models might not handle newer, higher-resolution formats.\nSpeaker Compatibility: Double-check compatibility between your speakers and source device. If they’re not designed to work together, sound problems can occur.\nConnectivity Headaches?

Consult your speaker’s user manual for pairing instructions.\nWi-Fi Network: For Wi-Fi speakers, check if they’re connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your device. Incorrect network settings can cause connection issues.\nSignal Interference: Move your speakers away from potential sources of interference, such as cordless phones or microwave ovens. These can disrupt wireless signals.\nFirmware Updates: Keep your speakers’ firmware up to date. Manufacturers release updates to address bugs and improve performance.\nRemember, these tips apply to common issues.
