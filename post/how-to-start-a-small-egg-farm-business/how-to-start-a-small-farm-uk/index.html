Evaluate Feed Availability: Assess your ability to provide adequate feed for your livestock. Consider growing your own feed or purchasing it locally to reduce costs. Prioritize Animal Welfare: Invest in comfortable housing, proper nutrition, and veterinary care to ensure the well-being of your animals. Healthy livestock are more productive and profitable.
