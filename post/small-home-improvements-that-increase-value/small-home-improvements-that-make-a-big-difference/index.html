How to Install New Lighting Fixtures\nInstalling new lighting fixtures is a relatively easy project that can be completed in a few hours. However, it’s important to follow all safety precautions and turn off the power to the circuit before you start working.\nAccent Lighting Ideas\nThere are many different ways to use accent lighting to highlight specific areas of a room. Here are a few ideas:\nUse sconces to highlight a piece of artwork. Place a table lamp on a console table to create a warm and inviting glow. Install recessed lighting to highlight a tray ceiling or a fireplace mantel. Use rope lighting to create a soft glow around the perimeter of a room.
