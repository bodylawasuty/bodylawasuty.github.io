Conversely, suburbs farther from the city or in less developed areas may offer more affordable options.\nProperty Size Understandably, the size of the property is a crucial determinant of affordability. Generally, larger lots and homes come with a higher price tag. If you’re willing to compromise on space, opting for a smaller property can lead to significant savings.\nAmenities Offered The amenities included in a house and land package can significantly impact its cost.
