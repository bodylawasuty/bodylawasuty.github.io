This helps reduce erosion, flooding, and pollutants from entering waterways. Native plants in a rain garden thrive on rainwater and help purify it.\n2. Native Plants: Choose native plants for your backyard. They’re adapted to your local climate and require less water and maintenance.

Compost Bin: Set up a compost bin to turn food scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich compost. Use compost as a natural fertilizer for your plants and improve soil health.\n5. Mulch: Mulch your garden beds with organic materials like straw, wood chips, or leaves. Mulch helps retain moisture, suppresses weeds, and adds nutrients to the soil.\n6. Permeable Hardscaping: Use permeable materials like gravel or pavers for pathways and patios. This allows rainwater to seep into the ground, reducing runoff and preventing erosion.\n7. Rain Barrels: Install rain barrels to collect rainwater from your roof. Use this water for irrigation, reducing your reliance on tap water.\n8. Solar Lighting: Install solar-powered lights in your backyard. These lights charge during the day and provide illumination at night without consuming electricity.\n9. Eco-Friendly Materials: When building or decorating your backyard, choose eco-friendly materials like recycled wood, bamboo, or sustainably harvested timber.\n10. Reduce Lawn Area: Consider reducing the size of your lawn and replacing it with drought-tolerant ground covers or native plants. This reduces water usage and maintenance.\nKey Takeaways: Create rain gardens to capture and filter rainwater runoff. Choose native plants that require less water and maintenance.
