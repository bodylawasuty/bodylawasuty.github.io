Higher resolution means sharper images. Look for a camera with at least 1080p resolution (1920x1080 pixels) for clear and detailed images.</p></li><li><p><strong>Video Compression:</strong> Video compression reduces the file size of video recordings without sacrificing quality. This is important for saving storage space and bandwidth. H.264 and H.265 are the most common video compression formats. H.265 is more efficient than H.264, but it may require more processing power.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Connectivity:</strong> Small HD security cameras can connect to your home network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Wi-Fi is more convenient, but Ethernet provides a more stable connection. If you have a large property or a lot of interference, Ethernet is the better choice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Night Vision:</strong> Night vision allows the camera to capture images in low-light conditions. Look for a camera with infrared (IR) LEDs for clear night vision. The number of IR LEDs affects the range of night vision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> Motion detection triggers the camera to start recording when it detects movement. This is a useful feature for security purposes. Some cameras also offer human detection, which can reduce false alarms caused by animals or other objects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audio Recording:</strong> Some small HD security cameras also have built-in microphones for audio recording. This can be useful for capturing conversations or other sounds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> Small HD security cameras typically store recordings on a microSD card or in the cloud. Cloud storage is more convenient, but it can also be more expensive. If you choose cloud storage, make sure you choose a plan that offers enough storage space for your needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>App Control:</strong> Many small HD security cameras can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. This allows you to view live footage, record videos, and adjust camera settings from anywhere.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Higher resolution means sharper images.

Higher resolution cameras produce sharper, more detailed images and videos. For small HD security cameras, aim for a resolution of at least 1080p (2MP).</p></li><li><p><strong>Field of View:</strong> The field of view (FOV) of a security camera determines the area it can cover. Wider FOV cameras capture a larger area, while narrower FOV cameras provide a more focused view. Consider the intended coverage area when choosing the FOV.</p></li><li><p><strong>Night Vision:</strong> Night vision is a crucial feature for security cameras operating in low-light or nighttime conditions. Look for cameras with infrared (IR) LEDs or starlight sensors for enhanced night vision capabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> Motion detection allows the camera to trigger recording or send alerts when movement is detected. This feature can help conserve storage space and reduce false alarms. Choose a camera with adjustable motion detection sensitivity to minimize false triggers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weatherproofing:</strong> If you plan to install the camera outdoors, consider its weatherproofing capabilities. Look for cameras with an IP65 or higher rating, indicating resistance to dust, rain, and other outdoor elements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Security cameras can connect to the internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable. Wi-Fi cameras offer flexibility in placement, while Ethernet cameras provide a more stable connection. Choose a camera with the appropriate connectivity option based on your network setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> Security cameras typically record footage onto a microSD card or cloud storage.
