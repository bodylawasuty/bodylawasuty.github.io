Researching local market trends is crucial for determining the demand for tiny homes in a specific area.\n2. Location and Amenities: The location of a tiny home significantly impacts its resale value. Proximity to urban centers, desirable neighborhoods, and amenities such as parks, schools, and public transportation can enhance its value.
