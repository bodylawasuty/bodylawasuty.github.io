Cost to Build RV Garage with Living Quarters Building an RV garage with living quarters can be a smart choice for RV enthusiasts who want a dedicated space to park their RV and enjoy additional living space. However, determining the cost to build an RV garage with living quarters can be a daunting task. This guide will provide you with a comprehensive breakdown of the factors that affect the cost, helping you make informed decisions and plan your budget accordingly.\n1. Size and Complexity of the Structure The size and complexity of your RV garage with living quarters will significantly impact the overall cost. A larger garage with more living space will require more materials and labor, driving up the total cost.
