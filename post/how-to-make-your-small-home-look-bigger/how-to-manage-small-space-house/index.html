Here&rsquo;s how:</p><ol><li><strong>Define Different Zones:</strong></li></ol><ul><li>Divide your space into specific zones to create a sense of order and purpose.

This way, you can save space without compromising on functionality.</li></ul><ol start=3><li><strong>Arrange Furniture Strategically:</strong></li></ol><ul><li>Place furniture strategically to create flow and maximize space.
